# Github & Git 101

## What will I learn during this session?
This session provides basic knowledge of Git and Github. After 90 minutes, you will contribute to a codebase and help build our very own website. You will also learn how to approve code changes from other developers.  :sparkles:

### Git
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

### Github :octocat:
If you are reading this, you are probably on Github.com. Github.com enables teams to collaborate on the same code base.

## Who uses Git and Github?
All major software companies use Git to build software. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Airbnb, and any startup you could think of.
